# MySongs

Xamarin.Forms MVVM app that consumes a Deezer public API, allowing you to search in hte Deezer catalog and save the song in a list of favorites

I've used flowListView (thanks to Daniel https://github.com/daniel-luberda/DLToolkit.Forms.Controls/tree/master/FlowListView) to show songs information.
