# Cookidea

Xamarin.Forms MVVM app that consumes an API, showing recipes for the ingredients you have searched.

In order the app to work, you need to change "apiKey" in DownloadService class with the API key you get for free at http://food2fork.com/about/api

I've used flowListView (thanks to Daniel https://github.com/daniel-luberda/DLToolkit.Forms.Controls/tree/master/FlowListView) to show recipes information.
